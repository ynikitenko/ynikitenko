# Software Architect | Scientific Computing | C++ / Python / HPC

I design high-performance, mathematically grounded software systems for scientific data analysis.

## Focus
- C++ / performance-critical systems
- Python data architectures
- Distributed workloads (Slurm, PBS)
- ETL pipelines and large-scale analysis
- Graph-level optimisation and execution design

## Selected Work
- **Lena** – Functional framework for composable scientific data analysis
- **ROOT/RDataFrame optimisation** – HPC-oriented analysis pipelines
- **Custom C++ modelling libraries** – High-throughput computational systems
- **yarsync (Debian/Ubuntu)** – File synchronisation tool

## Approach
- Architecture first
- Separation of mathematical logic and execution backend
- Reproducibility and long-term maintainability
- Performance without sacrificing clarity
